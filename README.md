# Collision Detection Algorithm Demo
 A visual demostration of KD trees spacial partitioning used for collision detection.
 This implementation does not actually generate a tree as i found it not nececarry for the purposes of this demo and instead only the lowest elements of the tree are saved and the interrated upon. However making it generate a tree should be easily done with minor modifications
